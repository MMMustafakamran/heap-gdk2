# Pausing the Agent for Input

> Pause an agent run, hand control to a custom Vue component, and resume with the user's answer.

## What is this?

`useInterrupt` lets your agent pause mid-run, hand control to the user through custom Vue UI, and resume with whatever the user returns. How that pause is implemented depends on the framework's runtime.







> **Not available on this framework.** `useInterrupt` is only meaningful when the underlying runtime exposes a native interrupt primitive. For other integrations, use [`useHumanInTheLoop`](../human-in-the-loop) instead — it is the standard hook for tool-call-based pause/resume flows and works on every framework that supports frontend tools.



## When should I use this?

Reach for `useInterrupt` when the pause is a **graph-enforced checkpoint** where the code path _must_ stop and wait for a human, not an LLM-initiated tool call. Typical cases:

- A sensitive action (payments, irreversible writes) must be approved
- A required piece of state isn't known and can only be collected from the user
- The agent explicitly reaches an approval node in a longer workflow
- You want the server-side contract to be `interrupt(...)` and resume with a payload

For LLM-initiated pauses where the model decides on the fly to ask the user, prefer [`useHumanInTheLoop`](../human-in-the-loop).







## AG-UI standard interrupt flow vs. legacy

`useInterrupt` supports two interrupt transports. Understanding which one your agent uses helps you write the right UI.

### Standard flow (`RUN_FINISHED` with `outcome.type === "interrupt"`)

When the agent backend conforms to the AG-UI protocol, it signals an interrupt by emitting a `RUN_FINISHED` event whose outcome carries the interrupts array:

```text
outcome.type === "interrupt"
outcome.interrupts  // Interrupt[]
```

The composable detects this on `onRunFinishedEvent` and exposes the interrupts after `onRunFinalized` fires. `slotProps.value` contains:

- **`interrupt`** — the primary `Interrupt` (`interrupts[0]`), with shape `{ id, reason, message?, toolCallId?, responseSchema?, expiresAt?, metadata? }`.
- **`interrupts`** — the full open set.
- **`resolve(payload?, interruptId?)`** — records a resolved response for the targeted interrupt. The run resumes once every open interrupt has a response.
- **`cancel(interruptId?)`** — records a cancelled response for the targeted interrupt. The same accumulate-then-submit logic applies.

### Legacy flow (`on_interrupt` custom event)

Older agents may emit a custom `on_interrupt` event. The composable exposes its payload in `event.value`, with `interrupt` set to `null` and `interrupts` to `[]`. Calling `resolve(payload)` resumes via `forwardedProps.command`, the legacy mechanism. `cancel()` dismisses the interrupt without resuming because the legacy transport has no cancel response.

### Priority

If both signals appear on the same run, the standard flow wins.

### Approve / Cancel example

```vue title="src/components/ApprovalPanel.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useInterrupt } from "@copilotkit/vue/v2";

const { slotProps } = useInterrupt({ renderInChat: false });
</script>

<template>
  <section v-if="slotProps">
    <p>{{ slotProps.interrupt?.message ?? "Approve this action?" }}</p>
    <button @click="slotProps.resolve({ approved: true })">Approve</button>
    <button @click="slotProps.cancel()">Cancel</button>
  </section>
</template>
```

Both methods return the `RunAgentResult` once the run restarts, or `void` while waiting for responses to other open interrupts.

### Multi-interrupt behavior

Some agents issue more than one interrupt in a single run. Each interrupt has its own `id`; address them individually:

```vue
<template>
  <ul v-if="slotProps">
    <li v-for="item in slotProps.interrupts" :key="item.id">
      {{ item.message }}
      <button @click="slotProps.resolve({ ok: true }, item.id)">Approve</button>
      <button @click="slotProps.cancel(item.id)">Cancel</button>
    </li>
  </ul>
</template>
```

The agent run resumes only after **every** open interrupt has been addressed. If you omit `interruptId`, the primary interrupt is targeted; Vue warns when several are open.

### `responseSchema` — surface only, no client-side validation

The `Interrupt` type exposes a `responseSchema` JSON Schema that the agent can use to describe the expected payload. `useInterrupt` surfaces it on `interrupt.responseSchema` for your UI to read, but it does **not** validate `resolve` payloads against it. Validation is the agent's responsibility on resume.

## Provider setup

The component calling `useInterrupt` must be a descendant of `CopilotKitProvider`:

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { CopilotKitProvider } from "@copilotkit/vue/v2";
import MeetingChat from "./components/MeetingChat.vue";
</script>

<template>
  <CopilotKitProvider runtime-url="/api/copilotkit">
    <MeetingChat />
  </CopilotKitProvider>
</template>
```
