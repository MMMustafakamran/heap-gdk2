# State Rendering

> Render your agent's state with custom UI components in real-time.

## What is this?

State rendering lets you build UI that reflects your agent's state in real-time. As your agent progresses through nodes and emits state updates, your frontend renders those changes, showing progress, drafts, or intermediate results.

  **Free course:** See this pattern built end-to-end in [Build Interactive Agents with Generative UI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/build-interactive-agents-with-generative-ui/) — a free DeepLearning.AI short course taught by CopilotKit's CEO covering the full Generative UI spectrum (Controlled, Declarative, and Open-Ended).

## When should I use this?

Use state rendering when you want to:

- Show real-time progress (e.g. "Researching... 2/5 complete")
- Display drafts that update as the agent works
- Build dashboards that reflect agent state
- Render structured output outside of the chat

## How it works in code

On the frontend, subscribe to the agent's state. Each time the backend forwards a fresh value, your component re-renders with the latest partial output. `useAgent` returns an `agent` ref; read `agent.value?.state` in script or let templates unwrap the ref. Keep the provider in an ancestor SFC.

```vue title="src/components/ResearchProgress.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { computed } from "vue";
import { useAgent, UseAgentUpdate } from "@copilotkit/vue/v2";

type ResearchState = { status?: string; draft?: string; completed?: number; total?: number };

const { agent } = useAgent({
  agentId: "researcher",
  updates: [UseAgentUpdate.OnStateChanged, UseAgentUpdate.OnRunStatusChanged],
});

const state = computed(() => (agent.value?.state ?? {}) as ResearchState);
</script>

<template>
  <section aria-live="polite">
    <p>{{ state.status ?? "Idle" }}</p>
    <progress :value="state.completed ?? 0" :max="state.total ?? 1" />
    <article v-if="state.draft">{{ state.draft }}</article>
  </section>
</template>
```

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { CopilotChat, CopilotKitProvider } from "@copilotkit/vue/v2";
import ResearchProgress from "./components/ResearchProgress.vue";
</script>

<template>
  <CopilotKitProvider runtime-url="/api/copilotkit">
    <ResearchProgress />
    <CopilotChat agent-id="researcher" />
  </CopilotKitProvider>
</template>
```

On the backend, a state-streaming mapping forwards a specific tool argument straight into a state key *as it's being generated*. Some frameworks provide that as middleware; direct SDK adapters can emit `STATE_SNAPSHOT` events from their streaming loop. Either way, the UI can watch the answer assemble token-by-token rather than appearing in one burst between checkpoints.

    ### Install the ADK + AG-UI bridge

    ```bash
    pip install ag-ui-adk
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Declare the predicted state mapping

    ADK state streaming uses `PredictStateMapping` to map the streaming
    `write_document` tool argument into `state["document"]`. Add
    `AGUIToolset()` to the agent so CopilotKit can forward the state deltas to
    the UI.

    ### Stop after the final model response

    The agent above imports `stop_on_terminal_text` and registers it as its
    `after_model_callback`. This prevents Gemini from issuing the same tool
    call again after its final text response. See the canonical
    [`stop_on_terminal_text` implementation](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/blob/main/showcase/integrations/google-adk/src/agents/shared_chat.py)
    when adapting the callback for your project.

Treat agent state as untrusted external data. Validate it before using it for privileged actions, and avoid putting secrets in state that is streamed to the browser.
